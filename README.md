# Autonomous Car with Computer Vision using YOLOv8 and ROS 2

This project implements a 1:10-scale autonomous vehicle capable of navigating an indoor environment using computer vision and deep learning. The system detects traffic lights and traffic signs in real time using a YOLOv8 model, while following road lines using a PID-controlled vision pipeline.

> Developed as part of the Intelligent Robotics Implementation course at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, in collaboration with Manchester Robotics.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Real-time traffic sign recognition with YOLOv8
